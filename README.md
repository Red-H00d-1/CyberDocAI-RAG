Of course. Let's get this running on your local machine. The setup involves running the Python backend server and then accessing the web interface through your browser.

Here is a step-by-step guide:

### **Step 1: Organize Your Project Files**

First, make sure all the files are in the correct place. Create a single folder for your project (e.g., `rag-chatbot`) and organize it exactly like this:

```
rag-chatbot/
├── app.py
├── index.html
├── requirements.txt
└── uploads/       <-- Create this empty folder
```

It's crucial that `app.py` and `index.html` are in the same main directory and that you create an empty `uploads` folder.

### **Step 2: Install the Required Python Libraries**

You'll need to install the Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. It's highly recommended to do this within a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2.  **Navigate into your project folder:**

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/rag-chatbot
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

      * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
      * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    You'll know it's active because your terminal prompt will change to show `(venv)`.

4.  **Install the libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This step might take a few minutes as it will download the embedding model and other necessary packages.

### **Step 3: Run the Backend Server**

Now, with the libraries installed, you can start the Flask server.

1.  Make sure you are still in your project folder (`rag-chatbot`) in the terminal, with the virtual environment active.

2.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3.  You should see output in your terminal indicating the server is running, similar to this:

    ```
    Initializing embedding model...
    Embedding model initialized.
    * Serving Flask app 'app'
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
    Press CTRL+C to quit
    ```

    **Do not close this terminal window.** The server needs to stay running for the application to work.

### **Step 4: Use the Chatbot\!**

1.  Open your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
2.  Go to the following address:
    [http://127.0.0.1:5000](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=http://127.0.0.1:5000)

The Cyber Security RAG Chatbot interface should load, and you can now upload your PDF documents and start asking questions. The frontend (`index.html`) will communicate with your local backend server (`app.py`) to handle all the logic.
